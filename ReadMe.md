# QuickWave Portable EEG

## Description
This project is the electrical and software components for the QuickWave Portable EEG.
QuickWave was my team's submission to Neuro Nexus: a multidisciplinary design competition that aims to bridge the gap between disciplines, accelerate research, and improve the translation of new ideas to impact neuroscience, neurological disorders, and mental health.
My team designed a portable, cheap, and fast EEG solution that is ideal for acute care settings. I personally focused on the embedded systems (all electrical and software components) and also helped present on Demo Day.

### What It Does
This project, if modified, should be able to replace the big, bulky EEG's that are currently in hospitals with a portable EEG machine the size of a phone.
However, before this project could be completed, funding was cut leaving it mostly theoretical with minimum testing.

### Technologies Used
The main technology used was just Google for research, as well as electrical simulation software. Most of the design for this was done based on research and verified with hand done math.

## Installation
All the web server code needs to go on the esp8266 and can be run via VS Code with Platform IO, and the processing code needs to go on an Arduino Nano.
Once everything is loaded, both programs need to be run via their IDE's. The webserver IP will be displayed on the output terminal and will then be able to be connected to.

## Usage
This project should not be used in a medical setting as it has too many flaws and has not been tested enough.
